abstract = {This paper describes the trigger and offline reconstruction, identification and energy calibration algorithms for hadronic decays of tau leptons employed for the data collected from pp collisions in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC center-of-mass energy $$\sqrt{\mathrm {s}} = 8$$   $$\,\hbox {TeV}$$ . The performance of these algorithms is measured in most cases with $$Z$$ decays to tau leptons using the full 2012 dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb $$^{-1}$$ . An uncertainty on the offline reconstructed tau energy scale of 2–4 %, depending on transverse energy and pseudorapidity, is achieved using two independent methods. The offline tau identification efficiency is measured with a precision of 2.5 % for hadronically decaying tau leptons with one associated track, and of 4 % for the case of three associated tracks, inclusive in pseudorapidity and for a visible transverse energy greater than 20 $$\,\hbox {GeV}$$ . For hadronic tau lepton decays selected by offline algorithms, the tau trigger identification efficiency is measured with a precision of 2–8 %, depending on the transverse energy. The performance of the tau algorithms, both offline and at the trigger level, is found to be stable with respect to the number of concurrent proton–proton interactions and has supported a variety of physics results using hadronically decaying tau leptons at ATLAS.},

@techreport{GSF,
abstract = {The ATLAS detector's ability to reconstruct and identify electrons with high precision is critical both for the calibration of the detector and for the analysis of many physics processes. High energy electrons traversing matter loose energy predominantly by bremsstrahlung. A well known model for bremsstrahlung is the Bethe-Heitler distribution, which is highly non-gaussian. Linear fitters, such as the Kalman Filter (KF), model energy losses as gaussian distributions and thus are not optimal for the reconstruction of electrons. The Gaussian-Sum Filter (GSF) is a non-linear generalisation of the KF. This algorithm has been implemented for the reconstruction of electrons within ATLAS. The GSF models the Bethe-Heitler distribution by a weighted sum of gaussian distributions. A comparison between the reconstruction performance of the GSF and the KF is presented using simulated events generated using the geometry of the 2004 ATLAS test-beam.},

@article{IBLproceedings,
abstract = {Run-2 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will provide new challenges to track and vertex reconstruction with higher energies, denser jets and higher rates. Therefore the ATLAS experiment has constructed the first 4-layer Pixel Detector in HEP, installing a new pixel layer, also called Insertable B-Layer (IBL). The IBL is a fourth layer of pixel detectors, and has been installed in May 2014 at a radius of 3.3 cm between the existing Pixel Detector and a new smaller radius beam-pipe. The new detector, built to cope with the high radiation and expected occupancy, is the first large scale application of 3D sensors and CMOS 130$\sim$nm readout electronics. In addition, the Pixel Detector was improved with a new service quarter panel to recover about 3\% of defective modules lost during Run-1 and a new optical readout system to readout the data at higher speed while reducing the occupancy when running with increased luminosity. Complementing detector improvements, many improvements to Inner Detector track and vertex reconstruction were developed during the two-year shutdown of the LHC. These include novel techniques developed to improve the performance in the dense cores of jets, optimisation for the expected conditions, and a software campaign which lead to a factor of three decrease in the CPU time needed to process each recorded event.},

@article{BCM,
abstract = {Beam conditions and the potential detector damage resulting from their anomalies have pushed the LHC experiments to build their own beam monitoring devices. The ATLAS Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) consists of two stations (forward and backward) of detectors each with four modules. The sensors are required to tolerate doses up to 500 kGy and in excess of 1015 charged particles per cm2 over the lifetime of the experiment. Each module includes two diamond sensors read out in parallel. The stations are located symmetrically around the interaction point, positioning the diamond sensors at z = 184 cm and r = 55 mm (a pseudo- rapidity of about 4.2). Equipped with fast electronics (2 ns rise time) these stations measure time-of-flight and pulse height to distinguish events resulting from lost beam particles from those normally occurring in proton-proton interactions. The BCM also provides a measurement of bunch-by-bunch luminosities in ATLAS by counting in-time and out-of-time collisions. Eleven detector modules have been fully assembled and tested. Tests performed range from characterisation of diamond sensors to full module tests with electron sources and in proton testbeams. Testbeam results from the CERN SPS show a module median-signal to noise of 11:1 for minimum ionising particles incident at a 45-degree angle. The best eight modules were installed on the ATLAS pixel support frame that was inserted into ATLAS in the summer of 2007. This paper describes the full BCM detector system along with simulation studies being used to develop the logic in the back-end FPGA coincidence hardware. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

The different calibration steps applied to the data and the optimization of the reconstruction of electron and photon energies are discussed. The absolute energy scale is set using a large sample of $Z$ boson decays into electron--positron pairs. The systematic uncertainty in the energy scale calibration varies between 0.03% to 0.2% in most of the detector acceptance for electrons with transverse momentum close to 45 GeV. For electrons with transverse momentum of 10 GeV the typical uncertainty is 0.3% to 0.8% and it varies between 0.25% and 1% for photons with transverse momentum around 60 GeV. Validations of the energy calibration with $J/\psi \rightarrow e^+e^-$ decays and radiative $Z$ boson decays are also presented.},

abstract = {The factor of four increase in the LHC luminosity, from $0.5\times 10^{34}\,\textrm{cm}^{-2}\textrm{s}^{-1}$ to $2.0\times 10^{34}\textrm{cm}^{-2}\textrm{s}^{-1}$, and the corresponding increase in pile-up collisions during the 2015-2018 data-taking period, presented a challenge for ATLAS to trigger on missing transverse momentum. The output data rate at fixed threshold typically increases exponentially with the number of pile-up collisions, so the legacy algorithms from previous LHC data-taking periods had to be tuned and new approaches developed to maintain the high trigger efficiency achieved in earlier operations. A study of the trigger performance and comparisons with simulations show that these changes resulted in event selection efficiencies of >98% for this period, meeting and in some cases exceeding the performance of similar triggers in earlier run periods, while at the same time keeping the necessary bandwidth within acceptable limits.},

@techreport{ElectronEfficiencyMeasurements2015,
abstract = {34 This note summarises the studies of the electron efficiency measurements using the data 35 at 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy collected in 2015 and corresponding to an integrated 36 luminosity of 3.2 fb −1. The studies are focused on electron reconstruction, identification, 37 trigger and isolation algorithms. The combination of these algorithms leads to a large 38 variety of operating points for the electron measurement, with diverse signal efficiency 39 versus background rejection performance. Samples of electron candidates with transverse 40 momenta above 7 GeV, in the central region of the detector defined by the pseudo rapidity 41 range |$\eta$| < 2.47 are selected using the tag-and-probe method for Z → ee and J/$\psi$ → ee 42 processes. The measurements performed on data are compared to the measurements done 43 on Monte Carlo simulations in the same phase space. The deviations are encapsulated in 44 data-to-MC ratios, provided for a variety of operating points, used in the physics analyses in 45 order to correct the Monte Carlo simulations. 46},

@article{TopoClusters,
abstract = {The reconstruction of the signal from hadrons and jets emerging from the proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and entering the ATLAS calorimeters is based on a three-dimensional topological clustering of individual calorimeter cell signals. The cluster formation follows cell signal-significance patterns generated by electromagnetic and hadronic showers. In this, the clustering algorithm implicitly performs a topological noise suppression by removing cells with insignificant signals which are not in close proximity to cells with significant signals. The resulting topological cell clusters have shape and location information, which is exploited to apply a local energy calibration and corrections depending on the nature of the cluster. Topological cell clustering is established as a well-performing calorimeter signal definition for jet and missing transverse momentum reconstruction in ATLAS.},
