ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16x16x26 m3with a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

@article{LHCf,
    abstract  = {LHCf is an experiment dedicated to the measurement of neutral particles emitted in the very forward region of LHC collisions. The physics goal is to provide data for calibrating the hadron interaction models that are used in the study of Extremely High-Energy Cosmic-Rays. This is possible since the laboratory equivalent collision energy of LHC is 1017 eV. Two LHCf detectors, consisting of imaging calorimeters made of tungsten plates, plastic scintillator and position sensitive sensors, are installed at zero degree collision angle ±140 m from an interaction point (IP). Although the lateral dimensions of these calorimeters are very compact, ranging from 20 mmx20 mm to 40 mmx40 mm, the energy resolution is expected to be better than 6% and the position resolution better than 0.2 mm for $\gamma$-rays with energy from 100 GeV to 7 TeV. This has been confirmed by test beam results at the CERN SPS. These calorimeters can measure particles emitted in the pseudo rapidity range n >8.4. Detectors, data acquisition and electronics are optimized to operate during the early phase of the LHC commissioning with luminosity below 10 30 cm-2s-1. LHCf is expected to obtain data to compare with the major hadron interaction models within a week or so of operation at luminosity ∼ 1029 cm-2s-1. After ∼10 days of operation at luminosity <∼-41029cm -2s-1, the light output of the plastic scintillators is expected to degrade by ∼10% due to radiation damage. This degradation will be monitored and corrected for using calibration pulses from a laser. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

    abstract      = {Run-2 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will provide new challenges to track and vertex reconstruction with higher energies, denser jets and higher rates. Therefore the ATLAS experiment has constructed the first 4-layer Pixel Detector in HEP, installing a new pixel layer, also called Insertable B-Layer (IBL). The IBL is a fourth layer of pixel detectors, and has been installed in May 2014 at a radius of 3.3 cm between the existing Pixel Detector and a new smaller radius beam-pipe. The new detector, built to cope with the high radiation and expected occupancy, is the first large scale application of 3D sensors and CMOS 130$\sim$nm readout electronics. In addition, the Pixel Detector was improved with a new service quarter panel to recover about 3\% of defective modules lost during Run-1 and a new optical readout system to readout the data at higher speed while reducing the occupancy when running with increased luminosity. Complementing detector improvements, many improvements to Inner Detector track and vertex reconstruction were developed during the two-year shutdown of the LHC. These include novel techniques developed to improve the performance in the dense cores of jets, optimisation for the expected conditions, and a software campaign which lead to a factor of three decrease in the CPU time needed to process each recorded event.},

The detector provides hermetic coverage with three cylindrical layers and three disks of Pixel Detectors on each side. It consists of approximately 80 million pixels that are individually read out via chips bump-bonded to 1744 n-in-n silicon substrates. In what follows, results from the successful operation of the Pixel Detector at the LHC and its status after 3 years of operation will be presented, including monitoring, calibration procedures and detector performance. The record breaking instantaneous luminosities of 7.7×1033cm-2s-1 recently reached at the Large Hadron Collider generate a rapidly increasing particle fluence in the ATLAS Pixel Detector. As the radiation dose accumulates, the first effects of radiation damage are now observable in the silicon sensors. A regular monitoring program has been conducted and reveals an increase in the silicon leakage current, which is found to be correlated with the rising radiation dose recorded by independent sensors within the inner detector volume. The fourth Pixel Detector layer at the radius of 3.3 cm will be added during the long shutdown 2013-2014 together with the replacement of the Pixel services.},

During the LHC Run 2 (2015–2018), the ATLAS trigger system operated successfully with excellent performance and flexibility by adapting to the various run conditions encountered and has been vital for the ATLAS Run-2 physics programme. For proton-proton running, approximately 1500 individual event selections were included in a trigger menu which specified the physics signatures and selection algorithms used for the data-taking, and the allocated event rate and bandwidth. The trigger menu must reflect the physics goals for a given data collection period, taking into account the instantaneous luminosity of the LHC and limitations from the ATLAS detector readout, online processing farm, and offline storage. This document discusses the operation of the ATLAS trigger system during the nominal proton-proton data collection in Run 2 with examples of special data-taking runs. Aspects of software validation, evolution of the trigger selection algorithms during Run 2, monitoring of the trigger system and data quality as well as trigger configuration are presented.},

The increased energy of the proton beams and the   higher luminosity required a redesign of LUCID to cope with the more   demanding conditions. The novelty of the LUCID-2 detector is that it   uses the thin quartz windows of photomultipliers as Cherenkov medium   and a small amounts of radioactive 207Bi sources deposited on   to these windows to monitor the gain stability of the   photomultipliers. The result is a fast and accurate luminosity   determination that can be kept stable during many months of data   taking. LUCID-2 can also measure the luminosity accurately online   for each of the up to 2808 colliding bunch pairs in the LHC . These   bunch pairs are separated by only 25 ns and new electronics has been   built that can count not only the number of pulses above threshold   but also integrate the pulses.},

This technique replaces the former clustering approach based on a connected component analysis and charge interpolation. The performance of the neural network splitting technique is quantified using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC collected by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and from Monte Carlo simulations. This technique reduces the number of clusters shared between tracks in highly energetic jets by up to a factor of three.

We examine some properties of a new member of this class, for which the power is negative. This ``anti-kt'' algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal.  None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split-merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, for which the anti-kt algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.}

                identification efficiencies are presented. They use the full Run
                2 data sample collected by the ATLAS experiment in pp collisions
                at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during the years 2015--2018,
                corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb−1. The
                measured electron identification efficiencies have uncertainties
                that are around 30\%--50\% smaller than the previous Run 2
                results due to an improved methodology and the inclusion of more
                data. A better pile-up subtraction method leads to electron
                isolation efficiencies that are more independent of the amount of
                pile-up activity. Updated photon identification efficiencies are
                also presented, using the full Run 2 data. When compared to the
                previous measurement, a 30\%--40\% smaller uncertainty is
                observed on the photon identification efficiencies, thanks to the
                increased amount of available data.},

    abstract = {The efficiency of the photon identification criteria in the ATLAS
                detector is measured using $$36.1\textbackslashhbox \{ fb\}^1$$to
                $$36.7\textbackslashhbox \{ fb\}^1$$of pp collision data at
                $$\textbackslashsqrt\{s\} = \textbackslashhbox \{13
                TeV\}$$collected in 2015 and 2016. The efficiencies are measured
                separately for converted and unconverted isolated photons, in
                four different pseudorapidity regions, for transverse momenta
                between 10 GeV and 1.5 TeV. The results from the combination of
                three data-driven techniques are compared with the predictions
                from simulation after correcting the variables describing the
                shape of electromagnetic showers in simulation for the average
                differences observed relative to data. Data-to-simulation
                efficiency ratios are determined to account for the small
                residual efficiency differences. These factors are measured with
                uncertainties between 0.5\% and 5\% depending on the photon
                transverse momentum and pseudorapidity. The impact of the
                isolation criteria on the photon identification efficiency, and
                that of additional soft pp interactions, are also discussed. The
                probability of reconstructing an electron as a photon candidate
                is measured in data, and compared with the predictions from
                simulation. The efficiency of the reconstruction of photon
                conversions is measured using a sample of photon candidates from
                $$Z\textbackslashrightarrow \textbackslashmu \textbackslashmu
                \textbackslashgamma $$events, exploiting the properties of the
                ratio of the energies deposited in the first and second
                longitudinal layers of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter.},

@article{AtlFast3,
    abstract = {The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider has a broad physics programme ranging from precision measurements to direct searches for new particles and new interactions, requiring ever larger and ever more accurate datasets of simulated Monte Carlo events. Detector simulation with Geant4 is accurate but requires significant CPU resources. Over the past decade, ATLAS has developed and utilized tools that replace the most CPU-intensive component of the simulation---the calorimeter shower simulation---with faster simulation methods. Here, AtlFast3, the next generation of high-accuracy fast simulation in ATLAS, is introduced. AtlFast3 combines parameterized approaches with machine-learning techniques and is deployed to meet current and future computing challenges, and simulation needs of the ATLAS experiment. With highly accurate performance and significantly improved modelling of substructure within jets, AtlFast3 can simulate large numbers of events for a wide range of physics processes.},
