@article{AntiKtAlgorithm,
    abstract  = {The kt and Cambridge/Aachen inclusive jet finding algorithms for hadron-hadron collisions can be seen as belonging to a broader class of sequential recombination jet algorithms, parametrised by the power of the energy scale in the distance measure. We examine some properties of a new member of this class, for which the power is negative. This ``anti-kt'' algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal.  None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split-merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, for which the anti-kt algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.},

                introduce a procedure, jet trimming, designed to mitigate these
                sources of contamination in jets initiated by light partons. This
                procedure is complimentary to existing methods developed for
                boosted heavy particles. We find that jet trimming can achieve
                significant improvements in event reconstruction, especially at
                high energy/luminosity hadron colliders like the LHC.},

    abstract = {One of the major challenges for the LHC will be to extract precise information from hadronic final states in the presence of the large number of additional soft pp collisions, pileup, that occur simultaneously with any hard interaction in high luminosity runs. We propose a novel technique, based on jet areas, that provides jet-by-jet corrections for pileup and underlying-event effects. It is data driven, does not depend on Monte Carlo modelling and can be used with any jet algorithm for which a jet area can be sensibly defined. We illustrate its effectiveness for some key processes and find that it can be applied also in the context of the Tevatron, low-luminosity LHC and LHC heavy-ion collisions.},

Over the past decade, ATLAS has developed and utilized tools that replace the most CPU-intensive component of the simulation---the calorimeter shower simulation---with faster simulation methods. Here, AtlFast3, the next generation of high-accuracy fast simulation in ATLAS, is introduced. AtlFast3 combines parameterized approaches with machine-learning techniques and is deployed to meet current and future computing challenges, and simulation needs of the ATLAS experiment. With highly accurate performance and significantly improved modelling of substructure within jets, AtlFast3 can simulate large numbers of events for a wide range of physics processes.},

    abstract = {The Pythia program is a standard tool for the generation of events in high-energy collisions, comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body hard process to a complex multiparticle final state. It contains a library of hard processes, models for initial- and final-state parton showers, matching and merging methods between hard processes and parton showers, multiparton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and several interfaces to external programs. Pythia 8.2 is the second main release after the complete rewrite from Fortran to C++, and now has reached such a maturity that it offers a complete replacement for most applications, notably for LHC physics studies. The many new features should allow an improved description of data.

@article{Pythia8.1,
    abstract = {The Pythia program is a standard tool for the generation of high-energy collisions, comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body hard process to a complex multihadronic final state. It contains a library of hard processes and models for initial- and final-state parton showers, multiple parton-parton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and interfaces to external programs. While previous versions were written in Fortran, Pythia 8 represents a complete rewrite in C++. The current release is the first main one after this transition, and does not yet in every respect replace the old code. It does contain some new physics aspects, on the other hand, that should make it an attractive option especially for LHC physics studies.

    abstract = {A new model for hadronic jet fragmentation in hard processes is presented. It is based on a QCD parton branching mechanism with correct treatment of leading collinear and infra-red singularities (i.e. including soft gluon interference). Hadronization occurs via preconfinement of colour singlet clusters, which decay according to a simple phase-space scheme. Although tightly constrained, the model gives a good account of existing e+ e− annihilation data. It predicts significant differences between quark and gluon jets. Comparisons with datadata on the CERN p̄p collider jets suggest that a large fraction of them are gluon jets. The model predicts soft gluon interference effects in hadron distributions which are probably not yet observable for pions but should be clear for kaons and baryons.},

For hadron collisions, we combine the updated fragmentation parameters with the new NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set. We use minimum-bias, Drell--Yan, and underlying-event data from the LHC to constrain the initial-state-radiation and multi-parton-interaction parameters, combined with data from SPS and the Tevatron to constrain the energy scaling. Several distributions show significant improvements with respect to the current defaults, for both {\$}{\$}ee{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}pp{\$}{\$}collisions, though we emphasize that interesting discrepancies remain in particular for strange particles and baryons.

Results are based on LO, NLO and NNLO QCD theory and also include electroweak corrections. To validate our methodology, we show that PDFs determined from pseudo-data generated from a known underlying law correctly reproduce the statistical distributions expected on the basis of the assumed experimental uncertainties. This closure test ensures that our methodological uncertainties are negligible in comparison to the generic theoretical and experimental uncertainties of PDF determination. This enables us to determine with confidence PDFs at different perturbative orders and using a variety of experimental datasets ranging from HERA-only up to a global set including the latest LHC results, all using precisely the same validated methodology. We explore some of the phenomenological implications of our results for the upcoming 13 TeV Run of the LHC, in particular for Higgs production cross-sections.},

All quark and lepton masses are generated as electromagnetic effects whereby intermediate states with mass of order 1 TeV play an important role. The hierarchy pattern of lepton and quark masses follows, if one intermediate heavy state dominates the self energy diagram. In the absence of O(α2) corrections the quarks of charge 23 are four times as heavy as the corresponding quarks of charge - 13. These relations are violated by radiative corrections, giving rise simultaneously to the phenomenon of flavor mixing. The mass of the t quark is expected to be in the range between 20 and 28 GeV.},

    abstract = {We study the possibility that the recently observed ℓ+ℓ−γ decays of the Z are due to the existence of an excited electron (muon) with approximately 75 GeV (60 GeV) mass. We point out that in a composite picture of leptons such states should fall in vectorlike SU(2) ⊗ U(1) multiplets, with weak isospin I ⩽ 3/2, and be coupled with a magnetic moment type transition to the light leptons. We study the relative rates of the Z→ ℓ+ℓ−γ or νν¯γ and W+ → ℓ+νγ, ℓ+νγ, ℓ+ℓ−(ff¯)+, νν¯(ff¯)+ channels, as means of determining the weak isospin assignment of the excited leptons. All present information is seen to be compatible with the existence of the required excited leptons, including the absence of observed anomalies in the e+e− → γγ cross sections and in the muon (g − 2). For spin 1/2, the distribution of the invariant mass for the direct lepton photon pair in ℓ+ℓ−γ events is expected to be flat, leaving unexplained why, in the observed three events, this mass is found to be less than about 10 GeV.},

The search is performed in five decay modes: γγ, ZZ, W+W−, τ+τ−, and bb¯. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, γγ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3±0.4(stat.)±0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.},

The authors review the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations in vacuum and in matter. They present the existing evidence from solar and atmospheric neutrinos as well as the results from laboratory searches, including the final status of the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) experiment. The theoretical inputs that are used to interpret the experimental results are described in terms of neutrino oscillations. The allowed ranges for the mass and mixing parameters are derived in two frameworks: First, each set of observations is analyzed separately in a two-neutrino framework; Second, the data from solar and atmospheric neutrinos are analyzed in a three-active-neutrino framework. The theoretical implications of these results are then discussed, including the existence of new physics, the estimate of the scale of this new physics, and the lessons for grand unified theories, for models of extra dimensions and singlet fermions in the bulk, and for flavor models.},

    abstract  = {Spectia of sixty-seven H Ir regions from 3 to 24 kpc from the nucleus of M31 have been obtained with the DTM image-tube spectrograph at a dispersion of 135 A mm '. Radial velocities, principally from Ha, have been determined with an accuracy of 10 km sec ' for most regions. Rotational velocities have been calculated under the assumption of circular motions only. For the region interior to 3 kpc where no emission regions have been identified, a narrow [N 13] x6583 emission line is observed. Velocities from this line indicate a rapid rotation in the nucleus, rising to a maximum circular velocity of V = 225 km at R = 400 pc, and falling to a deep minimum near R = 2 kpc. From the rotation curve for R < 24 kpc, the following disk model of M31 results. There is a dense, rapidly rotating nucleus of mass Al = (6 i 1) x 10' Alo. Near R = 2 kpc, the density is very low and the rotational motions are very small. In the region from 500 to 1.4 kpc (most notably on the southeast minor axis), gas is observed leaving the nucleus. Beyond R = 4 kpc the total mass of the galaxy increases approximately linearly to R = 14 kpc, and more slowly thereafter. The total mass to R = 24 kpc is = (1 85 t 0.1) x 10" Alo; one-half of it is located in the disk interior to R = 9 kpc In many respects this model resembles the model of the disk of our Galaxy Outside the nuclear region, there is no evidence for noncircular motions. The optical velocities, R > 3 kpc, agree with the 21-cm observations, although the maximum rotational velocity, V = 270 t 10 km sec ', is slightly higher than that obtained from 21-cm observations.},

@article{Planck-2014,
    abstract      = {This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter $\lambda$CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be $\theta$- = (1.04147 ± 0.00062) × 10-2, $\Omega$bh2 = 0.02205 ± 0.00028, $\Omega$ch2 = 0.1199 ± 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 ± 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0 = (67.3 ± 1.2) km s-1 Mpc-1, and a high value of the matter density parameter, $\Omega$m = 0.315 ± 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H0 and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter $\lambda$CDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter $\lambda$CDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r0.002 < 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find Neff = 3.30 ± 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of Neff = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w =-1.13-0.10+0.13. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter $\lambda$CDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an "anomaly" in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps which show that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8-sigma significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law, and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.},

@article{Brada-2008,
    abstract      = {We constrain the physical nature of dark matter using the newly identified massive merging galaxy cluster MACSJ0025.4-1222. As was previously shown by the example of the Bullet Cluster (1E0657-56), such systems are ideal laboratories for detecting isolated dark matter, and distinguishing between cold dark matter (CDM) and other scenarios (e.g. self-interacting dark matter, alternative gravity theories). MACSJ0025.4-1222 consists of two merging subclusters of similar richness at z=0.586. We measure the distribution of X-ray emitting gas from Chandra X-ray data and find it to be clearly displaced from the distribution of galaxies. A strong (information from highly distorted arcs) and weak (using weakly distorted background galaxies) gravitational lensing analysis based on Hubble Space Telescope observations and Keck arc spectroscopy confirms that the subclusters have near-equal mass. The total mass distribution in each of the subclusters is clearly offset (at >4sigma significance) from the peak of the hot X-ray emitting gas (the main baryonic component), but aligned with the distribution of galaxies. We measure the fractions of mass in hot gas (0.09^{+0.07}_{-0.03}) and stars (0.010^{+0.007}_{-0.004}), consistent with those of typical clusters, finding that dark matter is the dominant contributor to the gravitational field. Under the assumption that the subclusters experienced a head-on collision in the plane of the sky, we obtain an order-of-magnitude estimate of the dark matter self-interaction cross-section of sigma/m < 4cm^2/g, re-affirming the results from the Bullet Cluster on the collisionless nature of dark matter.},

@article{WMAP,
    abstract      = {New full-sky temperature and polarization maps based on seven years of data from WMAP are presented. The new results are consistent with previous results, but have improved due to reduced noise from the additional integration time, improved knowledge of the instrument performance, and improved data analysis procedures. The improvements are described in detail. The seven-year data set is well fit by a minimal six-parameter flat ACDM model. The parameters for this model, using the WMAP data in conjunction with baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and priors on H0 from Hubble Space Telescope observations, are $\Omega$bh2 = 0.02260 ± 0.00053, $\Omega$bh2 = 0.1123 ± 0.0035, $\Omega$ ∧ = 0.728+0.015-0.016, ns = 0.963 ± 0.012, $\tau$ = 0.087 ± 0.014, and $\sigma$8 = 0.809 ± 0.024 (68% CL uncertainties). The temperature power spectrum signal-to-noise ratio per multipole is greater that unity for multipoles l ≲ 919, allowing a robust measurement of the third acoustic peak. This measurement results in improved constraints on the matter density, $\Omega$mh2 = 0.1334+0.0056-0.0055, and the epoch of matter-radiation equality, zeq = 3196 +134-133-, using WMAP data alone. The new WMAP data, when combined with smaller angular scale microwave background anisotropy data, result in a 3a detection of the abundance of primordial helium, YHe = 0.326 ± 0.075. When combined with additional external data sets, the WMAP data also yield better determinations of the total mass of neutrinos, $\Sigma$ m $\nu$ ≤ 0.58 eV (95% CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, iVeff = 4.34+0.860.88. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is now determined to be ns = 0.963 ± 0.012, excluding the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by >3$\sigma$. These new WMAP measurements provide important tests of big bang cosmology. {\textcopyright} 2011. The American Astronomical Society.},
