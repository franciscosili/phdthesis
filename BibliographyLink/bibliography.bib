@article{AntiKtAlgorithm,
    abstract  = {The kt and Cambridge/Aachen inclusive jet finding algorithms for hadron-hadron collisions can be seen as belonging to a broader class of sequential recombination jet algorithms, parametrised by the power of the energy scale in the distance measure. We examine some properties of a new member of this class, for which the power is negative. This ``anti-kt'' algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal.  None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split-merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, for which the anti-kt algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.},

                introduce a procedure, jet trimming, designed to mitigate these
                sources of contamination in jets initiated by light partons. This
                procedure is complimentary to existing methods developed for
                boosted heavy particles. We find that jet trimming can achieve
                significant improvements in event reconstruction, especially at
                high energy/luminosity hadron colliders like the LHC.},

We propose a novel technique, based on jet areas, that provides jet-by-jet corrections for pileup and underlying-event effects. It is data driven, does not depend on Monte Carlo modelling and can be used with any jet algorithm for which a jet area can be sensibly defined. We illustrate its effectiveness for some key processes and find that it can be applied also in the context of the Tevatron, low-luminosity LHC and LHC heavy-ion collisions.},

Detector simulation with Geant4 is accurate but requires significant CPU resources. Over the past decade, ATLAS has developed and utilized tools that replace the most CPU-intensive component of the simulation---the calorimeter shower simulation---with faster simulation methods. Here, AtlFast3, the next generation of high-accuracy fast simulation in ATLAS, is introduced. AtlFast3 combines parameterized approaches with machine-learning techniques and is deployed to meet current and future computing challenges, and simulation needs of the ATLAS experiment. With highly accurate performance and significantly improved modelling of substructure within jets, AtlFast3 can simulate large numbers of events for a wide range of physics processes.},

@article{Pythia8.1,
    abstract = {The Pythia program is a standard tool for the generation of high-energy collisions, comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body hard process to a complex multihadronic final state. It contains a library of hard processes and models for initial- and final-state parton showers, multiple parton-parton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and interfaces to external programs. While previous versions were written in Fortran, Pythia 8 represents a complete rewrite in C++. The current release is the first main one after this transition, and does not yet in every respect replace the old code. It does contain some new physics aspects, on the other hand, that should make it an attractive option especially for LHC physics studies.

Ireland Licensing provisions: GPL version 2 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 176 981 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 2 411 876 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++ Computer: Commodity PCs Operating system: Linux; should also work on other systems RAM: 8 megabytes Classification: 11.2 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: yes, partly Nature of problem: High-energy collisions between elementary particles normally give rise to complex final states, with large multiplicities of hadrons, leptons, photons and neutrinos. The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to study physics at future experiments. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded physics models, transition from Fortran to C++. Summary of revisions: New user interface, transverse-momentum-ordered showers, interleaving with multiple interactions, and much more. Restrictions: Depends on the problem studied. Running time: 10–1000 events per second, depending on process studied. References: [1] T. Sjöstrand, P. Edén, C. Friberg, L. Lönnblad, G. Miu, S. Mrenna, E. Norrbin, Comput. Phys.
