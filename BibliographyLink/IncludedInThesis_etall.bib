abstract = {This paper describes the AC-coupled, single-sided, p-in-n silicon microstrip sensors used in the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) of the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The sensor requirements, specifications and designs are discussed, together with the qualification and quality assurance procedures adopted for their production. The measured sensor performance is presented, both initially and after irradiation to the fluence anticipated after 10 years of LHC operation. The sensors are now successfully assembled within the detecting modules of the SCT, and the SCT tracker is completed and integrated within the ATLAS Inner Detector. Hamamatsu Photonics Ltd. supplied 92.2% of the 15,392 installed sensors, with the remainder supplied by CiS. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{BulletCluster,
abstract = {We present new weak lensing observations of 1E0657-558 (z=0.296), a unique cluster merger, that enable a direct detection of dark matter, independent of assumptions regarding the nature of the gravitational force law. Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps which show that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8-sigma significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law, and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.},

We review devel-opments since the previous PDF4LHC recommendation, and discuss and compare the new generation of PDFs, which include substantial information from experimental data from the Run I of the LHC. We then propose a new prescription for the combination of a suitable subset of the available PDF sets, which is presented in terms of a single combined PDF set. We finally discuss tools which allow for the delivery of this combined set in terms of optimized sets of Hessian eigenvectors or Monte Carlo replicas, and their usage, and provide some examples of their application to LHC phenomenology. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Guido Altarelli (1941-2015), whose seminal work made possible the quantitative study of PDFs.},

abstract = {We examine a simple relativistic theory of two scalar fields, first discussed by Goldstone, in which as a result of spontaneous breakdown of U(1) symmetry one of the scalar bosons is massless, in conformity with the Goldstone theorem. When the symmetry group of the Lagrangian is extended from global to local U(1) transformations by the introduction of coupling with a vector gauge field, the Goldstone boson becomes the longitudinal state of a massive vector boson whose transverse states are the quanta of the transverse gauge field. A perturbative treatment of the model is developed in which the major features of these phenomena are present in zero order. Transition amplitudes for decay and scattering processes are evaluated in lowest order, and it is shown that they may be obtained more directly from an equivalent Lagrangian in which the original symmetry is no longer manifest. When the system is coupled to other systems in a U(1) invariant Lagrangian, the other systems display an induced symmetry breakdown, associated with a partially conserved current which interacts with itself via the massive vector boson. {\textcopyright} 1966 The American Physical Society.},

@article{zndefinition,
abstract = {Hypothesis tests for the presence of new sources of Poisson counts amidst background processes are frequently performed in high energy physics (HEP), gamma ray astronomy (GRA), and other branches of science. While there are conceptual issues already when the mean rate of background is precisely known, the issues are even more difficult when the mean background rate has non-negligible uncertainty. After describing a variety of methods to be found in the HEP and GRA literature, we consider in detail three classes of algorithms and evaluate them over a wide range of parameter space, by the criterion of how close the ensemble-average Type I error rate (rejection of the background-only hypothesis when it is true) compares with the nominal significance level given by the algorithm. We recommend wider use of an algorithm firmly grounded in frequentist tests of the ratio of Poisson means, although for very low counts the overcoverage can be severe due to the effect of discreteness. We extend the studies of Cranmer, who found that a popular Bayesian-frequentist hybrid can undercover severely when taken to high Z-values. We also examine the profile likelihood method, which has long been used in GRA and HEP; it provides an excellent approximation in much of the parameter space, as previously studied by Rolke and collaborators. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A number of important hard scattering processes are available, together with an interface via the Les Houches Accord to specialized matrix element generators for additional processes. The simulation of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics includes a range of models and allows new models to be added by encoding the Feynman rules of the model. The parton-shower approach is used to simulate initial- and final-state QCD radiation, including colour coherence effects, with special emphasis on the correct description of radiation from heavy particles. The underlying event is simulated using an eikonal multiple parton-parton scattering model. The formation of hadrons from the quarks and gluons produced in the parton shower is described using the cluster hadronization model. Hadron decays are simulated using matrix elements, where possible including spin correlations and off-shell effects. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag / Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Fisica.},

@article{MetPerformance,
abstract = {The performance of the missing transverse momentum (E$_{T}^{miss}$) reconstruction with the ATLAS detector is evaluated using data collected in proton-proton collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2015. To reconstruct E$_{T}^{miss}$, fully calibrated electrons, muons, photons, hadronically decaying $\tau$-leptons, and jets reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits and charged-particle tracks are used. These are combined with the soft hadronic activity measured by reconstructed charged-particle tracks not associated with the hard objects. Possible double counting of contributions from reconstructed charged-particle tracks from the inner detector, energy deposits in the calorimeter, and reconstructed muons from the muon spectrometer is avoided by applying a signal ambiguity resolution procedure which rejects already used signals when combining the various E$_{T}^{miss}$ contributions. The individual terms as well as the overall reconstructed E$_{T}^{miss}$ are evaluated with various performance metrics for scale (linearity), resolution, and sensitivity to the data-taking conditions. The method developed to determine the systematic uncertainties of the E$_{T}^{miss}$ scale and resolution is discussed. Results are shown based on the full 2015 data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$.},

The output data rate at fixed threshold typically increases exponentially with the number of pile-up collisions, so the legacy algorithms from previous LHC data-taking periods had to be tuned and new approaches developed to maintain the high trigger efficiency achieved in earlier operations. A study of the trigger performance and comparisons with simulations show that these changes resulted in event selection efficiencies of >98% for this period, meeting and in some cases exceeding the performance of similar triggers in earlier run periods, while at the same time keeping the necessary bandwidth within acceptable limits.},

None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split--merge steps, such as SISCone.

" We should like to point out how, primarily as a result of the exclusion principle, such a situation could arise. Consider a pair of electrons which interact above a quiescent Fermi sphere with an interaction of the kind. that might be expected due to the phonon and the screened Coulomb 6eld. s. If there is a net attraction between the electrons, it turns out that they can form a bound state, though their total energy is larger than zero. The properties of a noninteracting system of such bound pairs are very suggestive of those which could produce a superconducting state. To what extent the actual many-body system can be represented by such noninteracting pairs will be discussed in a forthcoming paper. Because of the similarity of the superconducting transition in a wide variety of complicated and differing metals, it is plausible to assume that the details of metal structure do not affect the qualitative features of the superconducting state. Thus, we neglect band and crystal structure and replace the periodic ion potential by a box of volume V. The electrons in this box are free except for further interactions between them which may arise due to Coulomb repulsions or to the lattice vibrations. In the presence of interaction between the electrons, we can imagine that under suitable circumstances there will exist a wave number qo below which the free states are unaffected by the interaction due to the large energy denominators required for excitation. They provide a floor (so to speak) for the possible transitions of electrons with wave number k;& qo. One can then consider the eigenstates of a pair of electrons with k$\sim$, k2) qo.

The summation over k' is limited by the exclusion principle to values of k& and k2 larger than qo, and by the delta function, which guarantees the conservation of the total momentum of the pair in a single scattering. The E dependence enters through the latter restriction. Bardeen and Pines' and Frohlich' have derived approximate formulas for the matrix element (k $\sim$ Hi $\sim$ k'); it is thought that the matrix elements for which the two electrons are confined to a thin energy shell near the Fermi surface, $\sim$l$\sim$e2 ep, are the principal ones involved in producing the superconducting state.

Although it is not necessary to limit oneself so strongly, the degree of uncertainty about the precise form of (k$\sim$ Hi $\sim$ k') makes it worthwhile to explore the consequences of reasonable but simple expressions.

@article{LHCf,
abstract = {LHCf is an experiment dedicated to the measurement of neutral particles emitted in the very forward region of LHC collisions. The physics goal is to provide data for calibrating the hadron interaction models that are used in the study of Extremely High-Energy Cosmic-Rays. This is possible since the laboratory equivalent collision energy of LHC is 1017 eV. Two LHCf detectors, consisting of imaging calorimeters made of tungsten plates, plastic scintillator and position sensitive sensors, are installed at zero degree collision angle ±140 m from an interaction point (IP). Although the lateral dimensions of these calorimeters are very compact, ranging from 20 mmx20 mm to 40 mmx40 mm, the energy resolution is expected to be better than 6% and the position resolution better than 0.2 mm for $\gamma$-rays with energy from 100 GeV to 7 TeV. This has been confirmed by test beam results at the CERN SPS. These calorimeters can measure particles emitted in the pseudo rapidity range n >8.4. Detectors, data acquisition and electronics are optimized to operate during the early phase of the LHC commissioning with luminosity below 10 30 cm-2s-1. LHCf is expected to obtain data to compare with the major hadron interaction models within a week or so of operation at luminosity ∼ 1029 cm-2s-1. After ∼10 days of operation at luminosity <∼-41029cm -2s-1, the light output of the plastic scintillators is expected to degrade by ∼10% due to radiation damage. This degradation will be monitored and corrected for using calibration pulses from a laser. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

This code allows to calculate transverse-momentum and invariant-mass distributions as well as total cross sections by combining the next-to-leading order predictions obtained by means of perturbative QCD with the resummation of the large logarithmic contributions arising in the small transverse-momentum region and close to the production threshold. The results computed in this way benefit from reduced theoretical uncertainties, compared to a pure next-to-leading order approach as currently employed in the experimental analyses searching for sleptons and gauginos at hadron colliders. This is illustrated by using of Resummino in the context of a typical supersymmetric benchmark point dedicated to superpartner searches at the Large Hadron Collider.},

@article{Run2TriggerOperation,
abstract = {The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider employs a two-level trigger system to record data at an average rate of 1 kHz from physics collisions, starting from an initial bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz. During the LHC Run 2 (2015–2018), the ATLAS trigger system operated successfully with excellent performance and flexibility by adapting to the various run conditions encountered and has been vital for the ATLAS Run-2 physics programme. For proton-proton running, approximately 1500 individual event selections were included in a trigger menu which specified the physics signatures and selection algorithms used for the data-taking, and the allocated event rate and bandwidth. The trigger menu must reflect the physics goals for a given data collection period, taking into account the instantaneous luminosity of the LHC and limitations from the ATLAS detector readout, online processing farm, and offline storage. This document discusses the operation of the ATLAS trigger system during the nominal proton-proton data collection in Run 2 with examples of special data-taking runs. Aspects of software validation, evolution of the trigger selection algorithms during Run 2, monitoring of the trigger system and data quality as well as trigger configuration are presented.},

@article{Nishijima2,
abstract = {{{{Based on the charge independence hypothesis the properties of V particles are theoretically investigated. It is found that the curious behaviours of these unstable particles are most simply interpreted in terms of the 1}-charge conservation law which directly results from the C. I. hypothesis and suitable isotopic spin assignments to these particles. The topics which are discussed in this paper are (a) the isotopic spin assignments to V particles, (b) the concept of the 1}-charge, (c) the 1}-charge conservation law which is to incorporate with the even-odd rule, the so-called " cascade " decay of some hyperons, and the positive excess of long-lived K particles, (d) the interpretation of heavy nuclear fragments, (e) the possible models of-r-mesons. {\S} I. Introduction Ever since the first observation by Rochester and Butler, so much information on hyperons and heavy mesons has been accumulated that some of the many puzzling ques{\textperiodcentered} tions on these curious particles are being resolved. We are sometimes motivated to seek for an ordering principle by which species of new particles can be described in a unified manner. It is expected that the solution of this problem would serve as a due to remove the difficulties inherent in the present field theory. Besides such problems of rather general nature, we are interested in speculating possible models of these unstable particles that can consistently account for their various properties together with their implications to the pion-nucleon interaction. In this paper, we shall investigate the latter problems. The theory of V particles is closely related to the pi-meson theory on which we base our arguments, and through the present work it will become clear that these particles are so strongly coupled to each other that we cannot treat them separately for quantitative calculations. Hence the theory of these strongly coupled particles is sharply contrasted to the quantum electrodynamics which is practically a dosed theory. As the quantitative theory of pion-nucleon interactions is not yet fully successful in explaining the experimental material, we cannot expect any quantitative theory of V particles at present. We shall rather discuss them qualitatively by making use of general invariance principles in quantum field theory but not referring to the details of the theory. Especially the principle of charge independence is found to play the most important role in understanding the characteristic features of these particles.},

@article{HiggsReviewATLAS10years,
abstract = {The standard model of particle physics1–4 describes the known fundamental particles and forces that make up our Universe, with the exception of gravity. One of the central features of the standard model is a field that permeates all of space and interacts with fundamental particles5–9. The quantum excitation of this field, known as the Higgs field, manifests itself as the Higgs boson, the only fundamental particle with no spin. In 2012, a particle with properties consistent with the Higgs boson of the standard model was observed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN10,11. Since then, more than 30 times as many Higgs bosons have been recorded by the ATLAS experiment, enabling much more precise measurements and new tests of the theory. Here, on the basis of this larger dataset, we combine an unprecedented number of production and decay processes of the Higgs boson to scrutinize its interactions with elementary particles. Interactions with gluons, photons, and W and Z bosons—the carriers of the strong, electromagnetic and weak forces—are studied in detail. Interactions with three third-generation matter particles (bottom (b) and top (t) quarks, and tau leptons ($\tau$)) are well measured and indications of interactions with a second-generation particle (muons, $\mu$) are emerging. These tests reveal that the Higgs boson discovered ten years ago is remarkably consistent with the predictions of the theory and provide stringent constraints on many models of new phenomena beyond the standard model. Ten years after the discovery of the Higgs boson, the ATLAS  experiment at CERN probes its kinematic properties with a significantly larger dataset from 2015–2018 and provides further insights on its interaction with other known particles.},

@article{Kibble,
abstract = {According to the Goldstone theorem, any manifestly covariant broken-symmetry theory must exhibit massless particles. However, it is known from previous work that such particles need not appear in a relativistic theory such as radiation-gauge electrodynamics, which lacks manifest covariance. Higgs has shown how the massless Goldstone particles may be eliminated from a theory with broken U(1) symmetry by coupling in the electromagnetic field. The primary purpose of this paper is to discuss the analogous problem for the case of broken non-Abelian gauge symmetries. In particular, a model is exhibited which shows how the number of massless particles in a theory of this type is determined, and the possibility of having a broken non-Abelian gauge symmetry with no massless particles whatever is established. A secondary purpose is to investigate the relationship between the radiation-gauge and Lorentz-gauge formalisms. The Abelian-gauge case is reexamined, in order to show that, contrary to some previous assertions, the Lorentz-gauge formalism, properly handled, is perfectly consistent, and leads to physical conclusions identical with those reached using the radiation gauge. {\textcopyright} 1967 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Jet energy scale measurements and their systematic uncertainties are reported for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton-proton collision data with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ collected during 2015 at the LHC. Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells, using the anti-$k_{t}$ algorithm with radius parameter $R = 0.4$. Jets are calibrated with a series of simulation-based corrections and in situ techniques. In situ techniques exploit the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon, $Z$ boson, or multijet system for jets with $20 < p_{T} < 2000$ GeV and pseudorapidities of $|\eta|<4.5$, using both data and simulation. An uncertainty in the jet energy scale of less than 1% is found in the central calorimeter region ($|\eta| < 1.2$) for jets with $100 < p_{T} < 500$ GeV. An uncertainty of about 4.5% is found for low-$p_{T}$ jets with $p_{T} = 20$ GeV in the central region, dominated by uncertainties in the corrections for multiple proton-proton interactions. The calibration of forward jets ($|\eta| > 0.8$) is derived from dijet $p_{T}$ balance measurements. For jets of $p_{T} = 80$ GeV, the additional uncertainty for the forward jet calibration reaches its largest value of about 2% in the range $|\eta| > 3.5$ and in a narrow slice of $2.2 < |\eta| < 2.4$.},

abstract = {Measurements of various features of the fluxes of atmospheric and solar neutrinos have provided evidence for neutrino oscillations and therefore for neutrino masses and mixing. The authors review the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations in vacuum and in matter. They present the existing evidence from solar and atmospheric neutrinos as well as the results from laboratory searches, including the final status of the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) experiment. The theoretical inputs that are used to interpret the experimental results are described in terms of neutrino oscillations. The allowed ranges for the mass and mixing parameters are derived in two frameworks: First, each set of observations is analyzed separately in a two-neutrino framework; Second, the data from solar and atmospheric neutrinos are analyzed in a three-active-neutrino framework. The theoretical implications of these results are then discussed, including the existence of new physics, the estimate of the scale of this new physics, and the lessons for grand unified theories, for models of extra dimensions and singlet fermions in the bulk, and for flavor models.},

@techreport{GSF,
abstract = {The ATLAS detector's ability to reconstruct and identify electrons with high precision is critical both for the calibration of the detector and for the analysis of many physics processes. High energy electrons traversing matter loose energy predominantly by bremsstrahlung. A well known model for bremsstrahlung is the Bethe-Heitler distribution, which is highly non-gaussian. Linear fitters, such as the Kalman Filter (KF), model energy losses as gaussian distributions and thus are not optimal for the reconstruction of electrons. The Gaussian-Sum Filter (GSF) is a non-linear generalisation of the KF. This algorithm has been implemented for the reconstruction of electrons within ATLAS. The GSF models the Bethe-Heitler distribution by a weighted sum of gaussian distributions. A comparison between the reconstruction performance of the GSF and the KF is presented using simulated events generated using the geometry of the 2004 ATLAS test-beam.},

Detector simulation with GEANT4 is accurate but requires significant CPU resources. Over the past decade, ATLAS has developed and utilized tools that replace the most CPU-intensive component of the simulation -- the calorimeter shower simulation -- with faster simulation methods. Here, AtlFast3, the next generation of high-accuracy fast simulation in ATLAS is introduced. AtlFast3 combines parameterized approaches with machine-learning techniques and is deployed to meet current and future computing challenges and simulation needs of the ATLAS experiment. With highly accurate performance and a new ability to model substructure within jets, AtlFast3 is designed to be used to simulate large numbers of events for a wide range of physics processes.},

@article{OtherMergingClusters,
abstract = {We constrain the physical nature of dark matter using the newly identified massive merging galaxy cluster MACSJ0025.4-1222. As was previously shown by the example of the Bullet Cluster (1E0657-56), such systems are ideal laboratories for detecting isolated dark matter, and distinguishing between cold dark matter (CDM) and other scenarios (e.g. self-interacting dark matter, alternative gravity theories). MACSJ0025.4-1222 consists of two merging subclusters of similar richness at z=0.586. We measure the distribution of X-ray emitting gas from Chandra X-ray data and find it to be clearly displaced from the distribution of galaxies. A strong (information from highly distorted arcs) and weak (using weakly distorted background galaxies) gravitational lensing analysis based on Hubble Space Telescope observations and Keck arc spectroscopy confirms that the subclusters have near-equal mass. The total mass distribution in each of the subclusters is clearly offset (at >4sigma significance) from the peak of the hot X-ray emitting gas (the main baryonic component), but aligned with the distribution of galaxies. We measure the fractions of mass in hot gas (0.09^{+0.07}_{-0.03}) and stars (0.010^{+0.007}_{-0.004}), consistent with those of typical clusters, finding that dark matter is the dominant contributor to the gravitational field. Under the assumption that the subclusters experienced a head-on collision in the plane of the sky, we obtain an order-of-magnitude estimate of the dark matter self-interaction cross-section of sigma/m < 4cm^2/g, re-affirming the results from the Bullet Cluster on the collisionless nature of dark matter.},

@article{ParticleFlow,
abstract = {This paper describes the implementation and performance of a particle flow algorithm applied to 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of ATLAS data from 8 TeV proton-proton collisions in Run 1 of the LHC. The algorithm removes calorimeter energy deposits due to charged hadrons from consideration during jet reconstruction, instead using measurements of their momenta from the inner tracker. This improves the accuracy of the charged-hadron measurement, while retaining the calorimeter measurements of neutral-particle energies. The paper places emphasis on how this is achieved, while minimising double-counting of charged-hadron signals between the inner tracker and calorimeter. The performance of particle flow jets, formed from the ensemble of signals from the calorimeter and the inner tracker, is compared to that of jets reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits alone, demonstrating improvements in resolution and pile-up stability.},

The different calibration steps applied to the data and the optimization of the reconstruction of electron and photon energies are discussed. The absolute energy scale is set using a large sample of $Z$ boson decays into electron--positron pairs. The systematic uncertainty in the energy scale calibration varies between 0.03% to 0.2% in most of the detector acceptance for electrons with transverse momentum close to 45 GeV. For electrons with transverse momentum of 10 GeV the typical uncertainty is 0.3% to 0.8% and it varies between 0.25% and 1% for photons with transverse momentum around 60 GeV. Validations of the energy calibration with $J/\psi \rightarrow e^+e^-$ decays and radiative $Z$ boson decays are also presented.},

abstract = {The ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider reads out particle collision data from over 100 million electronic channels at a rate of approximately $100$ kHz, with a recording rate for physics events of approximately 1 kHz. Before being certified for physics analysis at computer centres worldwide, the data must be scrutinised to ensure they are clean from any hardware or software related issues that may compromise their integrity. Prompt identification of these issues permits fast action to investigate, correct and potentially prevent future such problems that could render the data unusable. This is achieved through the monitoring of detector-level quantities and reconstructed collision event characteristics at key stages of the data processing chain. This paper presents the monitoring and assessment procedures in place at ATLAS during 2015-2018 data-taking. Through the continuous improvement of operational procedures, ATLAS achieved a high data quality efficiency, with 95.6% of the recorded proton-proton collision data collected at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV certified for physics analysis.},

abstract = {This paper presents the electron and photon energy calibration obtained with the ATLAS detector using about 36 fb$^{-1}$ of LHC proton-proton collision data recorded at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV in 2015 and 2016. The different calibration steps applied to the data and the optimization of the reconstruction of electron and photon energies are discussed. The absolute energy scale is set using a large sample of $Z$ boson decays into electron--positron pairs. The systematic uncertainty in the energy scale calibration varies between 0.03% to 0.2% in most of the detector acceptance for electrons with transverse momentum close to 45 GeV. For electrons with transverse momentum of 10 GeV the typical uncertainty is 0.3% to 0.8% and it varies between 0.25% and 1% for photons with transverse momentum around 60 GeV. Validations of the energy calibration with $J/\psi \rightarrow e^+e^-$ decays and radiative $Z$ boson decays are also presented.},

@article{SLACZResonance,
abstract = {We report on the final electroweak measurements performed with data taken at the Z resonance by the experiments operating at the electron-positron colliders SLC and LEP. The data consist of 17 million Z decays accumulated by the ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL experiments at LEP, and 600 thousand Z decays by the SLD experiment using a polarised beam at SLC. The measurements include cross-sections, forward-backward asymmetries and polarised asymmetries. The mass and width of the Z boson, mZ and $\Gamma$Z, and its couplings to fermions, for example the $\rho$ parameter and the effective electroweak mixing angle for leptons, are precisely measured: mZ = 91.1875 ± 0.0021 GeV, $\Gamma$Z = 2.4952 ± 0.0023 GeV, $\rho$l = 1.0050 ± 0.0010, sin2 $\theta$lepteff = 0.23153 ± 0.00016. The number of light neutrino species is determined to be 2.9840 ± 0.0082, in agreement with the three observed generations of fundamental fermions. The results are compared to the predictions of the Standard Model (SM). At the Z-pole, electroweak radiative corrections beyond the running of the QED and QCD coupling constants are observed with a significance of five standard deviations, and in agreement with the Standard Model. Of the many Z-pole measurements, the forward-backward asymmetry in b-quark production shows the largest difference with respect to its SM expectation, at the level of 2.8 standard deviations. Through radiative corrections evaluated in the framework of the Standard Model, the Z-pole data are also used to predict the mass of the top quark, mt = 173+13-10 GeV, and the mass of the W boson, mW = 80.363 ± 0.032 GeV. These indirect constraints are compared to the direct measurements, providing a stringent test of the SM. Using in addition the direct measurements of mt and mW, the mass of the as yet unobserved SM Higgs boson is predicted with a relative uncertainty of about 50% and found to be less than 285 GeV at 95% confidence level.},

@article{WMAP,
abstract = {New full-sky temperature and polarization maps based on seven years of data from WMAP are presented. The new results are consistent with previous results, but have improved due to reduced noise from the additional integration time, improved knowledge of the instrument performance, and improved data analysis procedures. The improvements are described in detail. The seven-year data set is well fit by a minimal six-parameter flat ACDM model. The parameters for this model, using the WMAP data in conjunction with baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and priors on H0 from Hubble Space Telescope observations, are $\Omega$bh2 = 0.02260 ± 0.00053, $\Omega$bh2 = 0.1123 ± 0.0035, $\Omega$ ∧ = 0.728+0.015-0.016, ns = 0.963 ± 0.012, $\tau$ = 0.087 ± 0.014, and $\sigma$8 = 0.809 ± 0.024 (68% CL uncertainties). The temperature power spectrum signal-to-noise ratio per multipole is greater that unity for multipoles l ≲ 919, allowing a robust measurement of the third acoustic peak. This measurement results in improved constraints on the matter density, $\Omega$mh2 = 0.1334+0.0056-0.0055, and the epoch of matter-radiation equality, zeq = 3196 +134-133-, using WMAP data alone. The new WMAP data, when combined with smaller angular scale microwave background anisotropy data, result in a 3a detection of the abundance of primordial helium, YHe = 0.326 ± 0.075. When combined with additional external data sets, the WMAP data also yield better determinations of the total mass of neutrinos, $\Sigma$ m $\nu$ ≤ 0.58 eV (95% CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, iVeff = 4.34+0.860.88. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is now determined to be ns = 0.963 ± 0.012, excluding the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by >3$\sigma$. These new WMAP measurements provide important tests of big bang cosmology. {\textcopyright} 2011. The American Astronomical Society.},

ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16x16x26 m3with a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

Tables of total cross sections are presented together with the corresponding scale and parton density uncertainties for benchmark points adopted recently by the experimental collaborations, and figures are presented for up-to-date model lines attached to them.

abstract = {Run-2 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will provide new challenges to track and vertex reconstruction with higher energies, denser jets and higher rates. Therefore the ATLAS experiment has constructed the first 4-layer Pixel Detector in HEP, installing a new pixel layer, also called Insertable B-Layer (IBL). The IBL is a fourth layer of pixel detectors, and has been installed in May 2014 at a radius of 3.3 cm between the existing Pixel Detector and a new smaller radius beam-pipe. The new detector, built to cope with the high radiation and expected occupancy, is the first large scale application of 3D sensors and CMOS 130$\sim$nm readout electronics. In addition, the Pixel Detector was improved with a new service quarter panel to recover about 3\% of defective modules lost during Run-1 and a new optical readout system to readout the data at higher speed while reducing the occupancy when running with increased luminosity. Complementing detector improvements, many improvements to Inner Detector track and vertex reconstruction were developed during the two-year shutdown of the LHC. These include novel techniques developed to improve the performance in the dense cores of jets, optimisation for the expected conditions, and a software campaign which lead to a factor of three decrease in the CPU time needed to process each recorded event.},

To cope with a fourfold increase of peak LHC luminosity from 2015 to 2018 (Run 2), to 2.1×1034cm-2s-1, and a similar increase in the number of interactions per beam-crossing to about 60, trigger algorithms and selections were optimised to control the rates while retaining a high efficiency for physics analyses. For proton–proton collisions, the single-electron trigger efficiency relative to a single-electron offline selection is at least 75% for an offline electron of 31 GeV, and rises to 96% at 60 GeV; the trigger efficiency of a 25 GeV leg of the primary diphoton trigger relative to a tight offline photon selection is more than 96% for an offline photon of 30 GeV. For heavy-ion collisions, the primary electron and photon trigger efficiencies relative to the corresponding standard offline selections are at least 84% and 95%, respectively, at 5 GeV above the corresponding trigger threshold.},

@article{SuperconductivityHiggsDiscussion,
abstract = {When first proposed in 1957, the BCS theory for superconductivity, which explained the quasi-totality of its thermodynamic and transport properties, was greeted with great circumspection, before it became the play ground of particle physicists, who largely contributed to understand the deep physics behind this phenomenon. In the course of this undertaking, revolutionizing new concepts in physics were brought to light, such as (i) the "physical significance of the phase" of a quantum mechanical wave function whose role in force-transmitting gauge fields is to control the interaction between elementary particles in a current conserving manner (ii) "spontaneous symmetry breaking" and its related to it collective Nambu-Goldstone modes, which encode the basic symmetry properties of a quantum vacuum and the associated to them conserved quatities, (iii) The "Anderson-Higgs mechanism" and its associated to it, but so far experimentally unconfirmed "Higgs field", which provides the introduction of massive force transmitting gauge fields and ultimately the mass of elementary particles. These concepts were vital in consolidating the standard model for elementary particles and presented the final answer to what distinguishes a superconducting from a non-superconducting state: "electromagnetic gauge symmetry breaking", whatever the microscospic mechanism for that might be. We illustrate here how these concepts gradually emerged, once the basic features, which characterize superconductivity - the Meissner-Ochsenfeld magnetic field screening and the fundamental London equations explaining them in a phenomenological way - were established.},

@article{RotationCurves,
abstract = {Strict criteria are applied to the sample of spiral galaxies with measured rotation curves in order to select those objects for which the observed rotation curve is an accurate tracer of the radial force law. The resulting sub-sample of 10 galaxies is then considered in view of two suggested explanations for the discrepancy beween the luminous mass and the conventional dynamical mass of galaxies: dark haloes and the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). This is done by means of least-squares fits to the rotation curves. Three-parameter dark-halo models (M/L for the visible disc, the core radius and the asymptotic circular velocity of the halo) work well in reproducing the observed rotation curves, and it is found that, for the higher luminosity galaxies, the visible matter dominates the mass distribution within the optically bright disc. However, in the low-luminosity gas-rich dwarfs the dark component is everywhere dominant. MOND, with one free parameter, (M/L for the visible disc) generally works well in predicting the form of the rotation curves, in some cases better than multi-parameter dark-halo fits. If the distance to the galaxy is also taken as a free parameter, then the MOND fits are as good as three parameter dark-halo models and, with one exception, the implied distances are consistent with the adopted distances within the probable uncertainty in the distance estimates. Restricting the number of parameter in dark-halo models by making use of the disc-halo coupling does not produce satisfactory fits to the rotation curves. The overall conclusion is that MOND is currently the best phenomenological description of the systematics of the discrepancy in galaxies.},

The classes are built on top of the RooFit package, which provides functionality for easily creating probability models, for analysis combinations and for digital publications of the results. We will present in detail the design and the implementation of the different statistical methods of RooStats. We will describe the various classes for interval estimation and for hypothesis test depending on different statistical techniques such as those based on the likelihood function, or on frequentists or bayesian statistics. These methods can be applied in complex problems, including cases with multiple parameters of interest and various nuisance parameters.},

We demonstrate the potential of the program by presenting selected phenomenological applications relevant to the LHC and to a 1-TeV $e^+e^-$ collider. While next-to-leading order results are restricted to QCD corrections to SM processes in the first public version, we show that from the user viewpoint no changes have to be expected in the case of corrections due to any given renormalisable Lagrangian, and that the implementation of these are well under way.},

@article{Planck,
abstract = {This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter $\lambda$CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be $\theta$- = (1.04147 ± 0.00062) × 10-2, $\Omega$bh2 = 0.02205 ± 0.00028, $\Omega$ch2 = 0.1199 ± 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 ± 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0 = (67.3 ± 1.2) km s-1 Mpc-1, and a high value of the matter density parameter, $\Omega$m = 0.315 ± 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H0 and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter $\lambda$CDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter $\lambda$CDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r0.002 < 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find Neff = 3.30 ± 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of Neff = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w =-1.13-0.10+0.13. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter $\lambda$CDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an "anomaly" in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

We show that all scenarios where the annihilation of light neutralinos rely mainly on the exchange of a light pseudoscalar are excluded by direct detection searches and by Fermi measurements of the $\gamma$−flux from dwarf spheroidal galaxies. On the other hand, we find scenarios with light sleptons that satisfy all collider and astroparticle physics constraints. In this case, the lower limit on the LSP mass is 12.6 GeV. We discuss how the parameter space of the model will be further probed by new physics searches at the LHC.},

@article{RubinKent,
abstract = {Spectia of sixty-seven H Ir regions from 3 to 24 kpc from the nucleus of M31 have been obtained with the DTM image-tube spectrograph at a dispersion of 135 A mm '. Radial velocities, principally from Ha, have been determined with an accuracy of 10 km sec ' for most regions. Rotational velocities have been calculated under the assumption of circular motions only. For the region interior to 3 kpc where no emission regions have been identified, a narrow [N 13] x6583 emission line is observed. Velocities from this line indicate a rapid rotation in the nucleus, rising to a maximum circular velocity of V = 225 km at R = 400 pc, and falling to a deep minimum near R = 2 kpc. From the rotation curve for R < 24 kpc, the following disk model of M31 results. There is a dense, rapidly rotating nucleus of mass Al = (6 i 1) x 10' Alo. Near R = 2 kpc, the density is very low and the rotational motions are very small. In the region from 500 to 1.4 kpc (most notably on the southeast minor axis), gas is observed leaving the nucleus. Beyond R = 4 kpc the total mass of the galaxy increases approximately linearly to R = 14 kpc, and more slowly thereafter. The total mass to R = 24 kpc is = (1 85 t 0.1) x 10" Alo; one-half of it is located in the disk interior to R = 9 kpc In many respects this model resembles the model of the disk of our Galaxy Outside the nuclear region, there is no evidence for noncircular motions. The optical velocities, R > 3 kpc, agree with the 21-cm observations, although the maximum rotational velocity, V = 270 t 10 km sec ', is slightly higher than that obtained from 21-cm observations.},

@article{BCM,
abstract = {Beam conditions and the potential detector damage resulting from their anomalies have pushed the LHC experiments to build their own beam monitoring devices. The ATLAS Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) consists of two stations (forward and backward) of detectors each with four modules. The sensors are required to tolerate doses up to 500 kGy and in excess of 1015 charged particles per cm2 over the lifetime of the experiment. Each module includes two diamond sensors read out in parallel. The stations are located symmetrically around the interaction point, positioning the diamond sensors at z = 184 cm and r = 55 mm (a pseudo- rapidity of about 4.2). Equipped with fast electronics (2 ns rise time) these stations measure time-of-flight and pulse height to distinguish events resulting from lost beam particles from those normally occurring in proton-proton interactions. The BCM also provides a measurement of bunch-by-bunch luminosities in ATLAS by counting in-time and out-of-time collisions. Eleven detector modules have been fully assembled and tested. Tests performed range from characterisation of diamond sensors to full module tests with electron sources and in proton testbeams. Testbeam results from the CERN SPS show a module median-signal to noise of 11:1 for minimum ionising particles incident at a 45-degree angle. The best eight modules were installed on the ATLAS pixel support frame that was inserted into ATLAS in the summer of 2007. This paper describes the full BCM detector system along with simulation studies being used to develop the logic in the back-end FPGA coincidence hardware. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

A parametric neural network is used to target several of the models with large backgrounds. In addition, results using orthogonal search regions are provided for all the models, simplifying alternative theoretical interpretations of the results.

abstract = {The ATLAS Pixel Detector is the innermost detector of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The detector provides hermetic coverage with three cylindrical layers and three disks of Pixel Detectors on each side. It consists of approximately 80 million pixels that are individually read out via chips bump-bonded to 1744 n-in-n silicon substrates. In what follows, results from the successful operation of the Pixel Detector at the LHC and its status after 3 years of operation will be presented, including monitoring, calibration procedures and detector performance. The record breaking instantaneous luminosities of 7.7×1033cm-2s-1 recently reached at the Large Hadron Collider generate a rapidly increasing particle fluence in the ATLAS Pixel Detector. As the radiation dose accumulates, the first effects of radiation damage are now observable in the silicon sensors. A regular monitoring program has been conducted and reveals an increase in the silicon leakage current, which is found to be correlated with the rising radiation dose recorded by independent sensors within the inner detector volume. The fourth Pixel Detector layer at the radius of 3.3 cm will be added during the long shutdown 2013-2014 together with the replacement of the Pixel services.},

@article{HistFitter,
abstract = {We present a software framework for statistical data analysis, called HistFitter, that has been used extensively by the ATLAS Collaboration to analyze big datasets originating from proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Since 2012 HistFitter has been the standard statistical tool in searches for supersymmetric particles performed by ATLAS. HistFitter is a programmable and flexible framework to build, book-keep, fit, interpret and present results of data models of nearly arbitrary complexity. Starting from an object-oriented configuration, defined by users, the framework builds probability density functions that are automatically fitted to data and interpreted with statistical tests. A key innovation of HistFitter is its design, which is rooted in core analysis strategies of particle physics. The concepts of control, signal and validation regions are woven into its very fabric. These are progressively treated with statistically rigorous built-in methods. Being capable of working with multiple data models at once, HistFitter introduces an additional level of abstraction that allows for easy bookkeeping, manipulation and testing of large collections of signal hypotheses. Finally, HistFitter provides a collection of tools to present results with publication-quality style through a simple command-line interface.},
