    abstract = {Presented is the search for anomalous Higgs boson decays into two axion-like particles (ALPs) using the full RunÂ 2 data set of $140~\text{fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of {\$}{\$}13{\backslash},{\backslash}text {\{}TeV{\}}{\$}{\$}recorded by the ATLAS experiment. The ALPs are assumed to decay into two photons, providing sensitivity to recently proposed models that could explain the {\$}{\$}(g-2){\_}{\backslash}mu {\$}{\$}discrepancy. This analysis covers an ALP mass range from 100 to {\$}{\$}62{\backslash},{\backslash}text {\{}GeV{\}}{\$}{\$}and ALP-photon couplings in the range {\$}{\$}10^{\{}-7{\}}{\backslash},{\backslash}text {\{}TeV{\}}^{\{}-1{\}}<C{\_}{\{}a{\backslash}gamma {\backslash}gamma {\}}/{\backslash}Lambda <1 {\backslash},{\backslash}text {\{}TeV{\}}^{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}, and therefore includes signatures with significantly displaced vertices and highly collinear photons. No significant excess of events above the Standard Model background is observed. Upper limits at 95{\%} confidence level are placed on the branching ratio of the Higgs boson to two ALPs in the four-photon final state, and are in the range of {\$}{\$} 10^{\{}-5{\}}{\$}{\$}to {\$}{\$}3{\backslash}times 10^{\{}-2{\}}{\$}{\$}, depending on the hypothesized ALP mass and ALP-photon coupling strength.},
