    abstract  = {A novel technique to identify and split clusters created by multiple charged particles in the ATLAS pixel detector using a set of artificial neural networks is presented. Such merged clusters are a common feature of tracks originating from highly energetic objects, such as jets. Neural networks are trained using Monte Carlo samples produced with a detailed detector simulation. This technique replaces the former clustering approach based on a connected component analysis and charge interpolation. The performance of the neural network splitting technique is quantified using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC collected by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and from Monte Carlo simulations. This technique reduces the number of clusters shared between tracks in highly energetic jets by up to a factor of three. It also provides more precise position and error estimates of the clusters in both the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolution.},

The studies presented focus on data taken during 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}s{\}} = 8{\$}{\$} TeV. The performance has been measured as a function of the number of interactions per bunch crossing over a wide range, from one to seventy.

A longitudinal vertex position resolution of about {\$}{\$}30{\backslash};{\backslash}upmu {\{}{\backslash}text {\{}m{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}is achieved for events with high multiplicity of reconstructed tracks. The transverse position resolution is better than {\$}{\$}20{\backslash};{\backslash}upmu {\{}{\backslash}text {\{}m{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}and is dominated by the precision on the size of the luminous region. An analytical model is proposed to describe the primary vertex reconstruction efficiency as a function of the number of interactions per bunch crossing and of the longitudinal size of the luminous region.

                four different pseudorapidity regions, for transverse momenta
                between 10 GeV and 1.5 TeV. The results from the combination of

The cluster formation follows cell signal-significance patterns generated by electromagnetic and hadronic showers. In this, the clustering algorithm implicitly performs a topological noise suppression by removing cells with insignificant signals which are not in close proximity to cells with significant signals. The resulting topological cell clusters have shape and location information, which is exploited to apply a local energy calibration and corrections depending on the nature of the cluster.

    abstract = {This paper describes the implementation and performance of a
                particle flow algorithm applied to 20.2 fb$$^\{-1\}$$of ATLAS
                data from 8 TeV proton--proton collisions in Run 1 of the LHC.
                The algorithm removes calorimeter energy deposits due to charged
                hadrons from consideration during jet reconstruction, instead
                using measurements of their momenta from the inner tracker. This
                improves the accuracy of the charged-hadron measurement, while
                retaining the calorimeter measurements of neutral-particle
                energies. The paper places emphasis on how this is achieved,
                while minimising double-counting of charged-hadron signals
                between the inner tracker and calorimeter. The performance of
                particle flow jets, formed from the ensemble of signals from the
                calorimeter and the inner tracker, is compared to that of jets
                reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits alone,
                demonstrating improvements in resolution and pile-up stability.},

@article{ATLAS-JetPileup-Run1,
    abstract = {The large rate of multiple simultaneous proton--proton
                interactions, or pile-up, generated by the Large Hadron Collider
                in Run 1 required the development of many new techniques to
                mitigate the adverse effects of these conditions. This paper
                describes the methods employed in the ATLAS experiment to correct
                for the impact of pile-up on jet energy and jet shapes, and for
                the presence of spurious additional jets, with a primary focus on
                the large 20.3 $$\textbackslashmathrm\{fb\}^\{-1\}$$data sample
                collected at a centre-of-mass energy of $$\textbackslashsqrt\{s\}

                techniques that incorporate sophisticated estimates of the
                average pile-up energy density and tracking information are
                presented. Jet-to-vertex association techniques are discussed and
                projections of performance for the future are considered. Lastly,
                the extension of these techniques to mitigate the effect of
                pile-up on jet shapes using subtraction and grooming procedures
                is presented.},
