    abstract = {Proton--proton collisions at {\$}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}s{\}}=7{\$} TeV and heavy ion collisions at {\$}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}s{\_}{\{}NN{\}}{\}}=2.76{\$} TeV were produced by the LHC and recorded using the ATLAS experiment's trigger system in 2010. The LHC is designed with a maximum bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz and the ATLAS trigger system is designed to record approximately 200 of these per second. The trigger system selects events by rapidly identifying signatures of muon, electron, photon, tau lepton, jet, and B meson candidates, as well as using global event signatures, such as missing transverse energy. An overview of the ATLAS trigger system, the evolution of the system during 2010 and the performance of the trigger system components and selections based on the 2010 collision data are shown. A brief outline of plans for the trigger system in 2011 is presented.},

    abstract      = {During 2015 the ATLAS experiment recorded 3.8 fb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The ATLAS trigger system is a crucial component of the experiment, responsible for selecting events of interest at a recording rate of approximately 1 kHz from up to 40 MHz of collisions. This paper presents a short overview of the changes to the trigger and data acquisition systems during the first long shutdown of the LHC and shows the performance of the trigger system and its components based on the 2015 proton--proton collision data.},

@article{ATLAS-Trigger-Performance-Run2,
    abstract      = {The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider employs a two-level trigger system to record data at an average rate of 1 kHz from physics collisions, starting from an initial bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz. During the LHC Run 2 (2015–2018), the ATLAS trigger system operated successfully with excellent performance and flexibility by adapting to the various run conditions encountered and has been vital for the ATLAS Run-2 physics programme. For proton-proton running, approximately 1500 individual event selections were included in a trigger menu which specified the physics signatures and selection algorithms used for the data-taking, and the allocated event rate and bandwidth. The trigger menu must reflect the physics goals for a given data collection period, taking into account the instantaneous luminosity of the LHC and limitations from the ATLAS detector readout, online processing farm, and offline storage. This document discusses the operation of the ATLAS trigger system during the nominal proton-proton data collection in Run 2 with examples of special data-taking runs. Aspects of software validation, evolution of the trigger selection algorithms during Run 2, monitoring of the trigger system and data quality as well as trigger configuration are presented.},

    abstract= {The luminosity determination for the ATLAS detector at the LHC during Run 2 is presented, with pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}s{\}}=13{\$}{\$} TeV. The absolute luminosity scale is determined using van der Meer beam separation scans during dedicated running periods in each year, and extrapolated to the physics data-taking regime using complementary measurements from several luminosity-sensitive detectors. The total uncertainties in the integrated luminosity for each individual year of data-taking range from 0.9{\%} to 1.1{\%}, and are partially correlated between years. After standard data-quality selections, the full Run 2 pp data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of {\$}{\$}140.1{\backslash}pm 1.2{\$}{\$} {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}fb{\}}^{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}, i.e. an uncertainty of 0.83{\%}.

@article{ATLAS-LUCID2,
    abstract  = {The ATLAS luminosity monitor, LUCID (LUminosity   Cherenkov Integrating Detector), had to   be upgraded for the second run of the LHC accelerator that started   in spring 2015. The increased energy of the proton beams and the   higher luminosity required a redesign of LUCID to cope with the more   demanding conditions. The novelty of the LUCID-2 detector is that it   uses the thin quartz windows of photomultipliers as Cherenkov medium   and a small amounts of radioactive 207Bi sources deposited on   to these windows to monitor the gain stability of the   photomultipliers. The result is a fast and accurate luminosity   determination that can be kept stable during many months of data   taking. LUCID-2 can also measure the luminosity accurately online   for each of the up to 2808 colliding bunch pairs in the LHC . These   bunch pairs are separated by only 25 ns and new electronics has been   built that can count not only the number of pulses above threshold   but also integrate the pulses.},
