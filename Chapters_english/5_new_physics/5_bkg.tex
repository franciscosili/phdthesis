With the event selection described in \Ch{\ref{ch:evt_selection}}, events with fragmentation photons and \(t\)-channel events were highly reduced and the signal significance was increased as well, providing an excellent scenario for bump searches. Now, in this chapter in \Sect{\ref{sec:bkg:estimation}}, the background estimation in these signal regions is described, in particular the ones from where a jet fakes a photon. The background in this type of resonance search is modeled with an analytical function, and several statistical tests are needed in order to define it. In \Sect{\ref{sec:bkg:modeling}}, the selection of the optimal function(s) is presented, where all the statistical tests to achieve so are discussed in detail.
