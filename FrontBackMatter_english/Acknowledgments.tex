% The past four years have been an incredible adventure with amazing people along the way I'd like to thank at this point.
% A first big thank you has to go to my supervisor,  Fabrizio Salvatore.  I could have not wished for a better person to guide me through this adventure.  Thank you for your wisdom and support in all aspects of the PhD,  not only the scientific parts. Your mentorship,  your incredible kindness and humour have been an invaluable support. You have helped me grow as a scientist and person.
% Thank you also to Antonella de Santo,  my second supervisor. Thank you for pointing me to great opportunities and for your support throughout this PhD. \\
% I'd like to thank the entire Sussex PI's and postdocs for creating a welcoming and supportive environment and always being open for discussions.  Thanks to the ATLAS PhD office crew for welcoming the newbies with open arms: Fab Trovato,  Mario Grandi,  Mario Spina,  Ioannis,  thanks for your open ears,  help and after work beers.  A special thanks has to go to Marco,  who I shared this PhD adventure with.  Thank you for pushing me to be confident in my work,  always being up for random discussions and being a good friend through the years. \\
% I started my time as PhD student in the Trigger Egamma ATLAS group.  I'd like to thank Fernando Monticelli for his kind help during and after my qualification task in answering all the trigger questions I could come up with, for his support and his continued friendship the last years.  I'd like to extend my thanks to the SUSY di-tau group with Xuai and Stefan.  A special thanks to Stefan for his continued support and great discussions about the analysis work, all things ATLAS, as well as the job hunt.  Thanks to Stefan Richter for very useful discussion on the electron ID.  Thanks also to Peter Tornambe for his continued friendship and open ear.\\
% Thanks to the BFWG for their financial support and for providing a welcoming,  encouraging and motivating network of likeminded women.  I'd like to thank Cynthia Burek in particular for her continued mentorship and guidance. \\
% I am very grateful to have crossed paths with Rusteem Ospanov during my time at CERN,  thank you for sharing your wisdom,  calmness and kindness at long conversations over coffee and lunch.
% To all my friends and family back home and distributed around the globe - thank you for your patience, support and effort to keep friendships alive. \\
% This thesis would have not been possible without my friends in Brighton, my family away from home. Ash (Aishwarya Padmanabhan),  Chinmay,  thank you for having my back when things get difficult and providing laughter,  joy,  good food and great trips when we all needed a break.  Ash,  thank you for pushing me when I needed a nudge,  especially when I didn't want to hear it.  Thanks for being incredibly loyal and the truest friend. 
% Thanks to my sister for providing laughter and joy, especially through her little ones. \\
% Lastly I want to thank my parents: Ohne euch w\"are diese Arbeit nicht m\"oglich gewesen.  Danke dass ihr immer an mich glaubt,  für mich da seid und mich unterst\"utzt,  was auch immer ich als nächstes anpacke!
